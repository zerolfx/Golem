Structure of a Photoshop-style APP13 segment

The Adobe's Photoshop program, a de-facto standard for image manipulation, uses the APP13 segment for storing non-graphic
information, such as layers, paths, IPTC data and more. The unit for this kind of information is called a "resource data block"
(because they hold data that was stored in the Macintosh's resource fork in early versions of Photoshop).
The content of an APP13 segment is formed by an identifier string (usually "Photoshop 3.0\000", but also 'Adobe_Photoshop2.5:',
used by earlier versions, is accepted; in this case some additional undocumented bytes are read (resolution info?) and saved in
a root 'Resolution' record) followed by a sequence of resource data blocks; a resource block has the following structure:

    [Record name]    [size]   [description]
    ---------------------------------------
    (Type)           4 bytes  Photoshop uses '8BIM' from ver 4.0 on
    (ID)             2 bytes  a unique identifier, e.g., "\004\004" for IPTC
    (Name)             ...    a Pascal string (padded to make size even)
    (Size)           4 bytes  actual size of resource data
    (Data)             ...    resource data, padded to make size even

(a Pascal string is made up of a single byte, giving the string length, followed by the string itself, padded to make size
even including the length byte; since the string length is explicit, there is no need of a terminating null character).
The signature (type) is usually '8BIM', but Photoshop used '8BPS' up to version 3.0, and some rogue program (Adobe PhotoDeluxe?)
is using 'PHUT' ("PHotoshop User Tags" ?) for path information (ID=7d0-bb7). Valid Image Resource IDs are listed in the
Photoshop-style tags' list section. In general a resource block contains only a few bytes, but there is an important block,
the IPTC block, which can be quite large; the structure of this block is analysed in more detail in the IPTC data block section.

Structure of an IPTC data block

An IPTC/NAA resource data block of a Photoshop-style APP13 segment embeds an IPTC stream conforming to the standard defined by
the International Press and Telecommunications Council (IPTC) and the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) for exchanging
interoperability information related to various news objects. The data part of a resource block, an IPTC stream, is simply a
sequence of units called datasets; no preamble nor count is present. Each dataset consists of a unique tag header and a data
field (the list of valid tags [dataset numbers] can be found in section about IPTC data). A standard tag header is used when
the data field size is less than 32768 bytes; otherwise, an extended tag header is used. The datasets do not need to show up
in numerical order according to their tag. The structure of a dataset is:

    [Record name]    [size]   [description]
    ---------------------------------------
    (Tag marker)     1 byte   this must be 0x1c
    (Record number)  1 byte   always 2 for 2:xx datasets
    (Dataset number) 1 byte   this is what we call a "tag"
    (Size specifier) 2 bytes  data length (< 32768 bytes) or length of ...
    (Size specifier)  ...     data length (> 32767 bytes only)
    (Data)            ...     (its length is specified before)

So, standard datasets have a 5 bytes tag header; the last two bytes in the header contain the data field length, the most
significant bit being always 0. For extended datasets instead, these two bytes contain the length of the (following) data
field length, the most significant bit being always 1. The value of the most significant bit thus distinguishes "standard"
from "extended"; in digital photographies, I assume that the datasets which are actually used (a subset of the standard) are
always standard; therefore, we likely do not have the IPTC block spanning more than one APP13 segment. The record types
defined by the IPTC-NAA standard are the following (but the "pseudo"-standard by Adobe for APP13 IPTC data is restricted to
the first application record, 2:xx, and sometimes to the envelope record, 1:xx, I believe, because everything else can be
accomodated more simply by other JPEG Segments):

    [Record name]                [dataset record number]
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Object Envelop Record                 1:xx
    Application Records:             2:xx through 6:xx
    Pre-ObjectData Descriptor Record:     7:xx
    ObjectData Record:                    8:xx
    Post-ObjectData Descriptor Record:    9:xx
